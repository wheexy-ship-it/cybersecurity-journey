# Day 1 â€“ Why I Started Documenting My Journey

I began learning cybersecurity over three months ago, focusing on topics like networking, threat detection, incidence response and SOC fundamentals. But today, I decided to start documenting my journey publicly on GitHub â€” not because I am just starting, but because I want to track my progress, stay consistent, and build a professional portfolio.

*Goal:* Become a SOC Analyst & Threat Hunter  
*Current Learning Platforms:* TryHackMe, Coursera, YouTube  
*Future Certifications:* CompTIA Security+, CySA+

### ðŸš€ Moving Forward

From today, every session, note, and lab will be documented here â€” not for perfection, but for progress. This is Day 1 of *documentation*, not learning.

This would be my accountability journal and portfolio.
